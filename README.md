# Zipline for Android (Demo)
## What is this?
This is a rapidly done prototype of an Android application. The purpose of this application was to demonstrate our idea for Startup Weekend DC during the weekend of November 13-15. The idea is that checking out with items you want to purchase at the store should not be a hassle. The solution to this is to allow users to checkout through their phones. There are some loose ends to this idea that we have solved for in our presentation so this code should not considered a complete representation of the idea but just a demo of it.

This is a demonstration of my work for a single startup weekend. Some things were done well. A lot of things were done poorly for sake of limited time. Please don't judge the code as a representation of my skill (unless it's in a positive manner!). 

## Do you have a video of it in action?
Sure. [Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gn_-omRU0w)

## Is it finished?
**No.**

## Will it ever be?
Probably, but not by me.

## Can I use the code here?
Sure. It's licensed under the MIT license so if you decide to use code from here, be sure to attribute it to me like specified in the license. However, this license does not apply to the copyrighted images and trademarks that were used for demonstration purposes that are included in the repository.
